# Feature Specification: Overcast Video Classroom Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-are-looking`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we are looking to build a video based classroom application called Overcast. The application provides a main lobby that displays 6 potential classrooms that the user can drop into. When they click on one of the classrooms they are taken to a live video feed of the classroom. They can, at any point, return to the lobby to attend a different classroom. Alternatively if a user clicks the instructor option from the lobby they enter into Instructor mode. When the user clicks a room from instructor mode they are given additional instructor privileges such as the ability to mute participants and begin breakout rooms."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: Video classroom application with lobby and instructor modes
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: students, instructors, classrooms, video feeds, lobby, privileges
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows for both student and instructor journeys
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Entities identified: User, Classroom, Session, Participant
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What is the maximum number of participants allowed per classroom? ‚Üí A: Medium classes (16-50 participants)
- Q: What information should be displayed for each classroom in the lobby? ‚Üí A: Just classroom names/numbers (minimal)
- Q: What authentication or access control is required for users to join classrooms? ‚Üí A: Simple name entry only
- Q: How should the system handle multiple instructors trying to control the same classroom? ‚Üí A: Multiple instructors with equal privileges
- Q: What happens when a classroom reaches its 50-participant capacity limit? ‚Üí A: Block new users with "classroom full" message

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Students want to easily browse and join live classroom sessions from a central lobby, with the ability to switch between different classes as needed. Instructors need the same browsing capability plus additional controls to manage their classroom sessions effectively, including participant management and breakout room functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Student Journey
1. **Given** a user opens the Overcast application, **When** they view the main lobby, **Then** they see 6 available classrooms displayed with simple names/numbers only
2. **Given** a student is in the lobby, **When** they click on a classroom and enter their name, **Then** they join the live video feed for that classroom as a participant
3. **Given** a student is viewing a classroom video feed, **When** they click "Return to Main Lobby", **Then** they are taken back to the lobby and can select a different classroom
4. **Given** a student switches between classrooms, **When** they join a new classroom, **Then** they automatically leave the previous classroom

#### Instructor Journey
1. **Given** a user is in the main lobby, **When** they click the "Instructors" button, **Then** they enter instructor mode and see the same 6 classrooms with instructor interface
2. **Given** an instructor clicks on a classroom, **When** they join as an instructor, **Then** they see the video feed plus instructor control panel
3. **Given** an instructor is in a classroom, **When** they use mute controls, **Then** they can mute/unmute individual participants or all participants
4. **Given** an instructor wants to create focused discussion groups, **When** they initiate breakout rooms, **Then** participants are divided into smaller video sessions

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle users trying to join after the "classroom full" message is displayed?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during video sessions?
- What occurs if an instructor leaves a classroom with active breakout rooms?
- How do multiple instructors coordinate when using controls simultaneously?
