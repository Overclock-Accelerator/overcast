## CODING STYLE & BEST PRACTICES

*   Write clean and easy-to-read code.
*   Focus on simplicity. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
*   Comment regularly. Explain WHY decisions were made, especially for newcomers.
*   Assume the project will be read by relative newcomers to full-stack development. Architecture should be accessible to junior developers. Use clear naming, avoid jargon, and explain complex patterns.
*   Where possible avoid creating excessive files. Rely on single files as much as possible. Minimize file count without sacrificing clarity. Keep related functionality together, avoid unnecessary splits.
*   Tests as living documentation. Test names and structure should teach how features work.
*   Favor straightforward solutions that newcomers can understand.
*   When simple solutions won't work, justify complexity.
*   When writing commit messages, ensure they are clear and educational.
*   Based on Overcast Constitution v1.0.0 (ratified 2025-10-02)

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

*   Pay close attention to task dependencies. Tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel *within their group*. Respect the dependency relationship between groups of tasks. For example, type definitions and constants must be created before components that rely on them.
*   When implementing tasks, mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
