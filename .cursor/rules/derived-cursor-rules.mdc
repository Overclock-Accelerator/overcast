## CODING STYLE & BEST PRACTICES

*   Write clean and easy-to-read code.
*   Focus on simplicity. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
*   Comment regularly. Explain WHY decisions were made, especially for newcomers.
*   Assume the project will be read by relative newcomers to full-stack development. Architecture should be accessible to junior developers. Use clear naming, avoid jargon, and explain complex patterns.
*   Where possible avoid creating excessive files. Rely on single files as much as possible. Minimize file count without sacrificing clarity. Keep related functionality together, avoid unnecessary splits.
*   Tests as living documentation. Test names and structure should teach how features work.
*   Favor straightforward solutions that newcomers can understand.
*   When simple solutions won't work, justify complexity.
*   When writing commit messages, ensure they are clear and educational.
*   Based on Overcast Constitution v1.0.0 (ratified 2025-10-02)
*   **Typescript:** Avoid using `any` type. Specify a more specific type whenever possible. If a variable is intentionally unused, consider prefixing it with an underscore (`_`) or commenting out the line to avoid ESLint errors. When handling Daily.co event types, be flexible and consider using `unknown` with type assertions to accommodate varying event structures.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

*   Pay close attention to task dependencies. Tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel *within their group*. Respect the dependency relationship between groups of tasks. For example, type definitions and constants must be created before components that rely on them.
*   When implementing tasks, mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
*   When encountering build errors, address them systematically:
    *   Start by resolving TypeScript and ESLint errors.
    *   Address type mismatches with precise type definitions or `unknown` with type assertions.
    *   Be mindful of Next.js version updates that may change API route handler signatures (e.g., Next.js 15 requires `await params` in dynamic routes).
    *   If Turbopack causes issues, try building with standard Next.js build (`npx next build`).

## DEBUGGING

*   When debugging Daily.co integration issues, utilize the following console logs in `app/components/Classroom.tsx`:
    *   `[Daily] Already initialized, skipping duplicate`
    *   `[Daily] Starting initialization...`
    *   `[Daily] Creating call object...`
    *   `[Daily] Call object created successfully`
    *   `[Classroom] Looking for classroom ID: X`
    *   `[Classroom] Found config: {...}`
    *   `[Classroom] Using Daily room URL: https://...`
    *   `[joinRoom] Attempting to join room: { url, userName, role, sessionId }`
    *   `[joinRoom] Join request completed successfully`
    *   `[joinRoom] Failed to join Daily room: ...`
    *   `[joinRoom] Room URL that failed: ...`
    *   `[joinRoom] Error details: {...}`
    *   `[joinRoom] Parsed error: {...}`
    *   `[Daily Event] Joined meeting successfully`
    *   `[Daily Event] Left meeting`
    *   `[Daily Event] Error occurred: ...`
    *   `[Daily Event] Error message: ...`
    *   `[Daily Event] Full error details: ...`
    *   `[Daily Event] Participant joined: ...`
    *   `[Daily Event] Participant left: ...`
