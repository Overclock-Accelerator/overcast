# Resolve task 18 (2025-10-02 08:07Z)

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet)**_

I'll help you resolve task 18. Let me first read the tasks file to understand what task 18 involves.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/002-we-are-looking/tasks.md

---

Now I can see that task 18 is: "Define Daily room configuration in lib/daily-config.ts (6 pre-defined room URLs)". Let me check if this file already exists and understand the requirements better by looking at the related documents.

---

Perfect! I can see that task 18 is already completed. The file `lib/daily-config.ts` exists and contains exactly what was required:

1. **6 pre-defined Daily room URLs** - The file defines `DAILY_ROOMS` array with 6 rooms (IDs 1-6)
2. **Environment variable integration** - Each room URL uses environment variables with fallback defaults
3. **Helper functions** - Includes `getDailyRoomById()` and `getAllDailyRoomUrls()` utilities
4. **Daily API configuration** - Contains `DAILY_API_CONFIG` with API settings and default room properties
5. **Proper TypeScript typing** - Uses `as const` for type safety

The implementation follows the constitutional principles:
- **Single file approach** - All Daily configuration in one file
- **Newcomer-friendly** - Clear comments explaining purpose and usage
- **Simple structure** - Straightforward array of room configurations
- **Educational comments** - Explains environment variables and API usage

Let me update the task status to mark T018 as completed:

## Task 18 Resolution Complete

**Plan**: Task 18 required defining Daily room configuration with 6 pre-defined room URLs in `lib/daily-config.ts`.

**Implementation**: The file already exists and contains:
- 6 Daily room configurations with environment variable integration
- Helper functions for room lookup and URL extraction  
- Daily API configuration with default room properties
- Proper TypeScript typing and educational comments

**Steps Taken**: 
1. Verified existing implementation meets all requirements
2. Confirmed constitutional compliance (single-file, newcomer-friendly, well-commented)
3. Marked task as completed

Task 18 is fully resolved. The Daily room configuration is ready for use by other components and API routes in the application.

- **T023**: Create ParticipantList component using useParticipants() in app/components/ParticipantList.tsx

Let me also check the existing types and dependencies to understand the structure better.

## Tasks 22-23 Implementation Complete

**Plan**: Implement VideoFeed and ParticipantList components using Daily React hooks for the Overcast classroom application.

**Implementation**: Created two core components:

### T022: VideoFeed Component (`app/components/VideoFeed.tsx`)
- **Daily React hooks integration**: Uses `useParticipants()`, `useLocalParticipant()`, `useScreenShare()`, `useDevices()`
- **Video display**: Renders local and remote participant videos using `DailyVideo` component
- **Screen sharing support**: Prioritizes screen share display when active
- **Responsive grid layout**: Adapts grid columns based on participant count (1-4 columns)
- **Role-based styling**: Different border colors for instructors vs students
- **Status indicators**: Shows audio/video mute states and participant roles
- **Performance optimization**: Configurable max participants limit

### T023: ParticipantList Component (`app/components/ParticipantList.tsx`)
- **Participant management**: Uses `useParticipants()` and `useLocalParticipant()` hooks
- **Role separation**: Groups participants into instructors and students sections
- **Instructor controls**: Mute/unmute individual participants and "mute all" functionality
- **Connection status**: Shows real-time connection state for each participant
- **Permission-based UI**: Only shows controls to instructors
- **Summary statistics**: Displays participant counts and muted status for instructors

**Steps Taken**:
1. Created VideoFeed component with comprehensive Daily React hooks integration
2. Implemented responsive video grid with screen sharing support
3. Created ParticipantList component with role-based participant management
4. Added instructor controls for participant muting
5. Included proper TypeScript typing and educational comments
6. Marked both tasks as completed in tasks.md
7. Verified no linter errors

Both components follow constitutional principles with single-file implementations, newcomer-friendly code structure, and extensive educational comments explaining Daily.co integration patterns.
