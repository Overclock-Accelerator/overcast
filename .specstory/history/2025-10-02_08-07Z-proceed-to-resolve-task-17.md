_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet)**_

I'll help you resolve task 17. Let me first read the tasks file to understand what task 17 involves.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/002-we-are-looking/tasks.md

---

Now I can see that task 17 is:

**T017 [P] Create TypeScript interfaces in lib/types.ts (AppUser, Classroom, ClassroomState, etc.)**

Let me check the data model and contracts to understand what interfaces need to be created.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/002-we-are-looking/data-model.md

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/002-we-are-looking/contracts/participants-api.yaml

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/002-we-are-looking/contracts/rooms-api.yaml

---

Now let me check if the `lib/types.ts` file already exists to see what's already there.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: lib/types.ts

---

I can see there's already a `lib/types.ts` file, but it doesn't match the comprehensive type definitions specified in the data model. Let me create a todo to track this task and then update the file with the complete type definitions based on the data model and API contracts.

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in lib/types.ts (AppUser, Classroom, ClassroomState, etc.)

Now I'll update the `lib/types.ts` file with the comprehensive type definitions based on the data model and API contracts:

## Task 17 Completed

I've successfully resolved task T017 by creating comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types.ts`. Here's what was implemented:

### Plan
1. Analyzed the data model and API contracts to understand required types
2. Replaced the existing basic types with comprehensive interfaces
3. Added proper documentation and comments for newcomer-friendly code

### Implementation
The updated `lib/types.ts` now includes:

**Core Entity Types:**
- `AppUser` - Application user with role, session, and classroom state
- `Classroom` - Static classroom configuration (1-6 rooms)
- `ClassroomState` - Runtime state with Daily.co participant data
- `Participant` - User presence within a specific classroom
- `BreakoutRoom` - Sub-sessions for group discussions

**API Contract Types:**
- Request/response interfaces for all endpoints (join/leave rooms, mute participants, etc.)
- Error handling types (`ApiError`, `ClassroomFullError`)
- Permission and status types for role-based access

**Daily.co Integration:**
- Configuration interfaces for Daily React hooks
- Re-exported Daily types for convenience
- Connection state management types

**Utility Types:**
- Form validation and loading state interfaces
- Type unions for connection and meeting states

### Key Features
- **Newcomer-friendly**: Extensive inline comments explaining each field
- **Type-safe**: Comprehensive coverage of all API contracts and data model entities  
- **Daily.co ready**: Proper integration with `@daily-co/daily-js` types
- **Future-proof**: Includes breakout room types for planned enhancements

The types are now ready to support the implementation of components, API routes, and Daily.co integration in subsequent tasks.

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet)**_

I'll implement tasks T020 and T021, which are creating the main Lobby component and the Classroom component. Let me first check the current status and understand what needs to be built.

## Tasks T020 and T021 Completed

I've successfully implemented both tasks:

### Plan
1. **T020**: Create main Lobby component with 6 classroom grid, user input form, and real-time capacity monitoring
2. **T021**: Create Classroom component with DailyProvider integration and connection management

### Implementation

**T020 - Lobby Component (`app/components/Lobby.tsx`):**
- **User Form**: Name input with validation (1-50 chars) and role selection (student/instructor)
- **6 Classroom Grid**: Dynamic cards showing participant counts, capacity bars, and join buttons
- **Real-time Updates**: Polls `/api/rooms` every 5 seconds for live participant counts
- **Capacity Management**: Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) and "Classroom Full" state
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions with loading overlays during join process
- **Futuristic Design**: Black/teal theme with gradient text and hover effects

**T021 - Classroom Component (`app/components/Classroom.tsx`):**
- **DailyProvider Wrapper**: Proper Daily.co context setup with call object initialization
- **Connection Management**: Full lifecycle handling (connecting → connected → disconnected)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with retry functionality
- **User Integration**: Displays user name, role, and session information
- **Event Handling**: Subscribes to Daily events (join/leave/error) with proper cleanup
- **Audio/Video Setup**: Applies configuration from constants with proper initialization
- **Header Component**: Shows classroom name, participant count, connection status, and leave button

### Key Features
- **Newcomer-friendly**: Extensive comments and clear component structure
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop with Tailwind CSS
- **Error-resilient**: Handles API failures and connection issues gracefully
- **Performance-optimized**: Proper useCallback/useEffect usage and cleanup
- **Daily.co ready**: Full integration with Daily React hooks and call management

Both components are ready for integration with the main application pages and API routes. The Lobby handles user onboarding and classroom selection, while the Classroom provides the foundation for video conferencing with Daily.co.
