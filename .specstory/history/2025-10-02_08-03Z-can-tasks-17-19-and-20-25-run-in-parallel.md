# Can tasks 17-19 and 20-25 run in parallel? (2025-10-02 08:03Z)

_**User (2025-10-02 07:03Z)**_

when looking at the task list can I run 17-19 and 20-25 in parallel?

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet)**_

I'll examine the task list to understand the dependencies between tasks 17-19 and 20-25 to determine if they can be run in parallel.

Looking at the task list, I can analyze the dependencies between tasks 17-19 and 20-25:

## Tasks 17-19 (Type Definitions and Constants):
- **T017**: Create TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types.ts`
- **T018**: Define Daily room configuration in `lib/daily-config.ts` 
- **T019**: Create app constants in `lib/constants.ts`

## Tasks 20-25 (Core Components):
- **T020**: Create Lobby component in `app/components/Lobby.tsx`
- **T021**: Create Classroom component in `app/components/Classroom.tsx`
- **T022**: Create VideoFeed component in `app/components/VideoFeed.tsx`
- **T023**: Create ParticipantList component in `app/components/ParticipantList.tsx`
- **T024**: Create InstructorControls component in `app/components/InstructorControls.tsx`
- **T025**: Create shared UI components in `app/components/ui/`

## Analysis:

**No, you cannot run tasks 17-19 and 20-25 in parallel.** Here's why:

1. **Direct Dependency**: Line 127 explicitly states: "T017-T019 (types/config) must complete before T020-T025 (components)"

2. **Technical Reason**: The components (T020-T025) will need to import and use the TypeScript interfaces from `lib/types.ts` (T017), the Daily configuration from `lib/daily-config.ts` (T018), and constants from `lib/constants.ts` (T019).

3. **Blocking Chain**: The task list shows that T018 (daily-config) also blocks T029-T034 (API routes), indicating these foundational files are critical dependencies.

## Recommended Execution Order:
1. **First**: Run T017-T019 sequentially or in parallel (they're all marked [P] and work on different files)
2. **Then**: Run T020-T025 in parallel (they're all marked [P] and work on different component files)

The [P] marking indicates tasks can run in parallel *within their group*, but the dependency relationship between the groups must be respected.
